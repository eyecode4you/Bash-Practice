## Looking at low-level hardware info

- kernel modules include device drivers, filesystem drivers, network drivers, system calls, and executable loaders. Usually has .ko extension
- A device driver acts as a translator between devices for interoperability
- Cold Plug device is already plugged into computer before boot, cannot be attached to an already-running computer, must shutdown first. E.g. sda1
